# Vika's 2022 Reading Diary

## Aim
Visual and scematic representation of the books read by [Vika Golubika](https://vikagolubika.ru/) in 2022. I drew some inspiration from [Shane Reynolds' dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shanetreynolds6/viz/Goodreads_16733018280490/LizzysGoodreads2022) on the similar topic.

## Data
The data is acquired from the Goodreads website. The csv file contains several columns:
- Title	
- Book Id	
- Author	
- Additional Authors
- ISBN	
- My Rating	
- Average Rating
- Publisher	
- Number of Pages	
- Year Published	
- Original Publication Year	
- Date Read	
- Bookshelves	
- Owned Copies
(and a few more)

## Tasks
1. Preprocess the dataset;
2. Translate text to English (where necessary);
3. Create a dashboard using Tableau Public.

## Results
1. The dashboard was crafted and published to Vika's delight.
2. There were a few problems with inaccurate data from Goodreads website (for instance, Date Read column was blank despite having values in the web version). 
3. I was able to add customary icons to the dashboard so that it looks more cozy. It also contains some interactive elements (parameters) that you can play with.
